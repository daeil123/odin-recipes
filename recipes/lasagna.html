    <h1>lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tender sheets of pasta, a creamy ricotta cheese filling, and a rich meaty tomato sauce are all topped with more cheese and baked until browned and bubbly.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
        <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
        <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Pasta:</strong>Cook in a large pot of salted water.</li>
        <li><Strong>Prepare meat sauce: </Strong>Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture: </strong> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer & Bake: </strong>Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
